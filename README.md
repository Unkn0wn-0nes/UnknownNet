UnknownNet
==========

UnknownNet is a Java-based networking architecture wrapping around the TCP and UDP networking protocols, primiarly focusing on game servers, but can be used for other types of software. It contains a client library for clients to use and a server base for you to build a game server over without dealing with the pesky networking code.

You are not required to submit patches/bug fixes/enchancements upstream, but if you find a bug, security issue, or have a nice little enchancement you think would prove helpful, we'd love to incoperate into the project. You are not required to give credit if you include this in your project, but it is always nice.

Notice
=========
UnknownNet has support for SSL client/server sockets using the javax.net and javax.net.ssl libraries. SSL supported can be disabled by setting the 'useSSL' paramter to false on the client and server.
